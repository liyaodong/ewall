# Ewall

## Why this idea?

I have a lot's of information need take look everyday, one idea is set the screensaver to a website. the ewall's idea is for organize those frames.
i.e.:
|----------|----------|
| Emall | WorkLog |
|----------|----------|
| Todo | Github |
|----------|----------|

## That's all diea?

No.. I also want practice the ReasonML language with ReasonReact.
